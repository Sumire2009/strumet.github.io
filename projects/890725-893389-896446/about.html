    <p>EAT Architects' Moving House in Kew, Melbourne,
      is immediately striking for its spaciousness,
      soft light and breezy atmosphere. EAT director
      Albert Mo and his team performed their customary
      architectural magic to deliver a private and light-
      filled home, although faced with a site whose north
      face opened to the street. A white screen of aluminium
      slats also envelopes much of the house, fulfilling a
      number of functions. Its simple form, in the outline
      of a suburban gable roof, offers structural clarity
      while subtly referencing the houses on either side
      in colour and form; and the partially transparent
      screen lends lightness to the exterior design.</p>
